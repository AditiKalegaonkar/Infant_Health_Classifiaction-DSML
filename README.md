# INFANT-HEALTH-CLASSIFICATION
DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

The Synthetic Infant Health Classification dataset plays a crucial role in the medical field by enabling predictions of health outcomes through generated, or mimicked, data. Given the confidentiality that often surrounds medical data, this approach facilitates predictive analytics while mitigating privacy risks. The development of mimic data allows organizations to enhance data utilization and increase engagement among users and contributors.

Due to regulatory constraints, numerous health-related datasets remain inaccessible, posing challenges for researchers and analysts in obtaining vital information. In this regard, synthetic datasets are often preferred.

The health data of infants aged 0 to 30 days is especially sensitive, creating further obstacles for analysis. However, it is essential to investigate health issues in this demographic to enable early disease diagnosis, which benefits both healthcare professionals and related industries.

Machine Learning and Data Science have significant applications in this area, expediting the diagnostic process and enabling timely interventions. In this article, I will apply my knowledge of these fields to predict the health conditions of infants using Python libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I will employ both the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms for predictions, utilizing the provided dataset to train the model.
